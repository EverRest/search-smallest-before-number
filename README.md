## Description
Given an array of positive random numbers, for example: $dataset = [ 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21 ];
You need to write a class that will have one or more methods that (in different ways, if there are several methods, more is better) return the next smallest number from the array after the passed argument, or -1 in case of an error.
Example: f(11) => 10 f(14) => 12
You also need to write tests for the unit class under phpunit. We do not use frameworks and libraries other than phpunit.
